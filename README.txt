32-bit Processor designed for my Advanced Processors class. My code was mainly based off the code from 
https://www.fpga4student.com/2017/04/verilog-code-for-16-bit-risc-processor.html, but it isn't necessarily copied word for word per se.

I made this in ISE Design Suite and I took the files I've created from there. You may very well need the `timescale line of code at the top, but I just took the module
code from it which might have been a mistake looking back.

If you want to test the processor itself, run the test_processor.v file to test everything, but there are also test modules to test individual blocks.

This commit doesn't have any useful comments in the source code, so sorry about that. I might add some more useful comments in the future however.
